# Packer Plugin for VMware vSphere

The Packer Plugin for VMware vSphere is a multi-component plugin can be used with [HashiCorp Packer][packer] to create virtual machine images for [VMware vSphere][docs-vsphere]. 

The plugin includes two builders which are able to create images, depending on your desired strategy:

* `vsphere-iso` - This builder starts from an ISO file and utilizes the vSphere API to build images on a vSphere cluster or ESXi host by connecting to a vCenter Server instance. 

* `vsphere-clone` - This builder clones an existing virtual machine template, modifies the template, and then saves it as a new image. The builder uses the vSphere API to build images on a vSphere cluster or ESXi host by connecting to a vCenter Server instance.  

## Requirements

* [VMware vSphere][docs-vsphere] 6.5 or later.

    The provider supports versions in accordance with the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix from General Availability to End of General Support.
