# VMware vSphere Supervisor Builder

Type: `vsphere-supervisor`
Artifact BuilderId: `vsphere.supervisor`

This builder deploys and publishes new VMs to a vSphere Supervisor cluster using VM Service.
If you are new to VM Service, please refer to [Deploying and Managing Virtual Machines in vSphere with Tanzu
](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-F81E3535-C275-4DDE-B35F-CE759EA3B4A0.html) for more information.

- It uses a kubeconfig file to connect to the vSphere Supervisor cluster.
- It uses the [VM-Operator API](https://vm-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/) to deploy and configure the source VM.
- It uses the Packer provisioners to customize the VM after establishing a successful connection.
- It publishes the customized VM as a new VM image to the designated content library in vSphere.
- The builder supports versions following the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix
  from General Availability to End of General Support. Builds on versions that
  are end of support may work, but configuration options may throw errors if
  they do not exist in the vSphere API for those versions.

## Examples

Example Packer template:

**HCL2**

```hcl
source "vsphere-supervisor" "example-vm" {
  image_name = "<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>"
  class_name = "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>"
  storage_class = "<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>"
  bootstrap_provider = "<CloudInit, Sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest OS>"
  bootstrap_data_file = "<Path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest OS customization>"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm"]
}
```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor",
      "image_name": "<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>",
      "class_name": "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>",
      "storage_class": "<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>",
      "bootstrap_provider": "<CloudInit, Sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest OS>",
      "bootstrap_data_file": "<Path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest OS customization>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deprovisioning Tasks

If you would like to clean up the VM after the build is complete, you could use the Ansible
provisioner to run the following tasks to delete machine-specific files and data.

**HCL2**

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.vm"]

  provisioner "ansible" {
    playbook_file = "cleanup-playbook.yml"
  }
}
```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible",
      "playbook_file": "./cleanup-playbook.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```
