# VMware vSphere Supervisor Builder

Type: `vsphere-supervisor`

Artifact BuilderId: `vsphere.supervisor`

This builder creates a virtual machine on a vSphere Supervisor cluster using the VM-Operator API.

Refer to [Deploying and Managing Virtual Machines in vSphere with Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-F81E3535-C275-4DDE-B35F-CE759EA3B4A0.html)
for more information on the VM Service functionality in vSphere with Tanzu.

- It uses a `kubeconfig` file to connect to the vSphere Supervisor cluster.
- It uses the [VM-Operator API](https://vm-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/) to deploy
  and configure the source virtual machine.
- It cna use Packer provisioners to customize the virtual machine after establishing a successful
  connection.
- It publishes the customized virtual machine as a new virtual machine image to the designated
  content library in vSphere.

-> **Note:** This builder is developed to maintain compatibility with VMware vSphere versions until
their respective End of General Support dates. For detailed information, refer to the
[Broadcom Product Lifecycle](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productlifecycle).

## Examples

Examples are available in the [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vsphere/tree/main/examples/)
directory of the GitHub repository.

HCL Example:

```hcl
source "vsphere-supervisor" "example-vm" {
  image_name = "<image name of the source virtual machine, e.g. 'ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg'>"
  class_name = "<virtual machine class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>"
  storage_class = "<storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>"
  bootstrap_provider = "<cloud-init, sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest os>"
  bootstrap_data_file = "<path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest os customization>"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm"]
}
```

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor",
      "image_name": "<image name of the source virtual machine, e.g. 'ubuntu-24.04-server-cloudimg'>",
      "class_name": "<virtual machine class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>",
      "storage_class": "<storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>",
      "bootstrap_provider": "<cloud-init, sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest os>",
      "bootstrap_data_file": "<path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest os customization>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deprovisioning Tasks

If you would like to clean up the virtual machine after the build is complete, you can use the
[Ansible provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/integrations/hashicorp/ansible/latest/components/provisioner/ansible)
to run the following tasks to delete machine-specific files and data.

HCL Example:

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.vm"]

  provisioner "ansible" {
    playbook_file = "cleanup-playbook.yml"
  }
}
```

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible",
      "playbook_file": "./cleanup-playbook.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```
