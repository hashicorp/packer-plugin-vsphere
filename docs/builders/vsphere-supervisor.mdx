# VMware vSphere Supervisor Builder

Type: `vsphere-supervisor`

Artifact BuilderId: `vsphere.supervisor`

This builder creates a virtual machine on a vSphere Supervisor cluster using the VM-Operator API.

Refer to [Deploying and Managing Virtual Machines in vSphere Supervisor](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-services-and-workloads-8-0/deploying-and-managing-virtual-machines-in-vsphere-iaas-control-plane.html)
for more information on the VM Service functionality in vSphere Supervisor.

- It uses a `kubeconfig` file to connect to the vSphere Supervisor cluster.
- It uses the [VM-Operator API](https://vm-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/) to deploy
  and configure the source virtual machine.
- It cna use Packer provisioners to customize the virtual machine after establishing a successful
  connection.
- It publishes the customized virtual machine as a new virtual machine image to the designated
  content library in vSphere.

-> **Note:** This builder is developed to maintain compatibility with VMware vSphere versions until
their respective End of General Support dates. For detailed information, refer to the
[Broadcom Product Lifecycle](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productlifecycle).

## Examples

Examples are available in the [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vsphere/tree/main/examples/)
directory of the GitHub repository.

HCL Example:

```hcl
source "vsphere-supervisor" "example-vm" {
  image_name = "<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>"
  class_name = "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>"
  storage_class = "<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>"
  bootstrap_provider = "<CloudInit, Sysprep, or vAppConfig to customize the guest OS>"
  bootstrap_data_file = "<Path to the file containing the bootstrap data for guest OS customization>"
  publish_location_name = "<target location / content library for the published image, optional, e.g. 'cl-6066c61f7931c5ef9'>"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm"]
}
```

HCL Example with image import:

```hcl

  import_source_url = "<Remote URL to import image from, optional, e.g. 'https://example.com/example.ovf'>"
  import_source_ssl_certificate = "<SSL certificate of the remote HTTPS server, optional, e.g. '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----xxxxx-----END CERTIFICATE-----'>"
  import_target_location_name = "<Target location / content library for the imported image, optional, e.g. 'cl-6066c61f7931c5ef9'>"
  import_target_image_type = "<Target image type of the imported image, optional, e.g. 'ovf'>"
  import_target_image_name = "<Target image name of the imported image for the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>"
  class_name = "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>"

  publish_location_name = "<target location / content library for the published image, optional, e.g. 'cl-6066c61f7931c5ef9'>"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm"]
}
```

## Deprovisioning Tasks

If you would like to clean up the virtual machine after the build is complete, you can use the
[Ansible provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/integrations/hashicorp/ansible/latest/components/provisioner/ansible)
to run the following tasks to delete machine-specific files and data.

HCL Example:

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.vm"]

  provisioner "ansible" {
    playbook_file = "cleanup-playbook.yml"
  }
}
```

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible",
      "playbook_file": "./cleanup-playbook.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```
