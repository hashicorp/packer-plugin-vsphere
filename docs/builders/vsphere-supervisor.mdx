# VMware vSphere Supervisor Builder

Type: `vsphere-supervisor`
Artifact BuilderId: `vsphere.supervisor`

This builder deploys new VMs to a vSphere Supervisor cluster.

- It uses kubeconfig file to connect to the vSphere Supervisor cluster.
- It uses the VM-Service API to deploy and configure the source VM.
- It uses the Packer provisioners to customize the VM after deployment.
- Planned enhancements that will introduce the ability to publish the
  customized VM as a new VM image to the vSphere endpoint.
- The builder supports versions following the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix
  from General Availability to End of General Support. Builds on versions that
  are end of support may work, but configuration options may throw errors if
  they do not exist in the vSphere API for those versions.

## Examples

Example Packer template:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "vsphere-supervisor" "example-vm" {
  image_name = "<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>"
  class_name = "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>"
  storage_class = "<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.example-vm"]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor",
      "image_name": "<Image name of the source VM, e.g. 'ubuntu-impish-21.10-cloudimg'>"
      "class_name": "<VM class that describes the virtual hardware settings, e.g. 'best-effort-large'>",
      "storage_class": "<Storage class that provides the backing storage for volume, e.g. 'wcplocal-storage-profile'>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deprovisioning Tasks

If you would like to clean up the VM after the build is complete, you can use the Ansible provisioner to run the following tasks to delete machine-specific files and data.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.vsphere-supervisor.vm"]

  provisioner "ansible" {
    playbook_file = "cleanup-playbook.yml"
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vsphere-supervisor"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible",
      "playbook_file": "./cleanup-playbook.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
