# vSphere Post-Processor

Type: `vsphere`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.post-processor.vsphere`

The Packer vSphere post-processor takes an artifact and uploads it to a vSphere endpoint.
The artifact must have a vmx/ova/ovf image.

## Configuration

There are many configuration options available for the post-processor. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

Required:

- `cluster` (string) - The vSphere cluster or ESXi host to upload the VM. This can be
  either the name of the vSphere cluster or the FQDN/IP address of an ESXi host.

- `datacenter` (string) - The name of the datacenter within the vSphere environemnt
   to add the VM.

- `datastore` (string) - The name of the datastore to place the VM. This is
  _not required_ if `resource_pool` is specified.

- `host` (string) - The vSphere endpoint that will be contacted to perform
  the VM upload.

- `password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to the endpoint.

- `username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to the endpoint.

- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the VM after upload.

Optional:

- `esxi_host` (string) - Target ESXi host. Used to assign specific ESXi
  host to upload the resulting VM, when a vCenter Server is used as
  `host`. Can be either an FQDN (e.g., "esxi-01.example.com", requires proper DNS
  setup and/or correct DNS search domain setting) or an IPv4 address.

- `disk_mode` (string) - Target disk format. See `ovftool` manual for
  available options. Default: `thick`.

- `insecure` (boolean) - Whether or not the connection can be done
  over an insecure connection. Default: `false`

- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - When `true`, preserve the local VM files,
  even after importing them to the vSphere endpoint. Default: `false`.

- `resource_pool` (string) - The resource pool in which to upload the VM.

- `vm_folder` (string) - The folder within the datastore to place the VM.

- `vm_network` (string) - The name of the network in which to place the VM.

- `overwrite` (boolean) - If `true`, force the system to overwrite the
  existing files instead create new ones. Default: `false`

- `hardware_version` (string) - The virtual hardware version that the VM
  should be deployed with. Use when deploying to vSphere / ESXi host whose version
  is different than the the one used to create the artifact. See
  [VMware KB 1003746](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746) for more information 
  on the virtual hardware versions supported by each vSphere / ESXi version.

- `options` (array of strings) - Custom options to add in `ovftool`. See
  `ovftool --help` to list all the options

# Example

The following is an example of the vSphere post-processor being used in
conjunction with the null builder to upload a vmx to a vSphere cluster.

You can also use this post-processor with the vmx artifact from a build.

```hcl

# Privileges

The post-processor uses `ovftool` and therefore needs the same privileges
as `ovftool`. Rather than giving full administrator access, you can create a role
to give the post-processor the permissions necessary to run. Below is an example
role. Please note that this is a user-supplied list so there may be a few
extraneous permissions that are not strictly required.

For vSphere the role needs the following privileges:

    Datastore.AllocateSpace
    Host.Config.AdvancedConfig
    Host.Config.NetService
    Host.Config.Network
    Network.Assign
    System.Anonymous
    System.Read
    System.View
    VApp.Import
    VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk
    VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig
    VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete

And this role must be authorized on the:

    Cluster of the host
    The destination folder (not on Datastore, on the vSphere logical view)
    The network to be assigned
    The destination datastore.
