# vSphere Post-Processor

Type: `vsphere`

Artifact BuilderId: `packer.post-processor.vsphere`

This post-processor uploads an artifact to a vSphere endpoint.

The artifact must be a VMX, OVA, or OVF file.

-> **Note:** This post-processor is developed to maintain compatibility with VMware vSphere versions until
their respective End of General Support dates. For detailed information, refer to the
[Broadcom Product Lifecycle](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productlifecycle).

## Configuration Reference

The following configuration options are available for the post-processor.

**Required:**

@include 'post-processor/vsphere/Config-required.mdx'

**Optional:**

@include 'post-processor/vsphere/Config-not-required.mdx'

- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - Preserve the local virtual machines files, even after importing
  them to the vSphere endpoint. Defaults to `false`.

## Example Usage

The following is an example of the post-processor used in conjunction with the `null` builder to
upload a VMX to a vSphere cluster. You can also use this post-processor with the VMX artifact from a
build.

An example is shown below, showing only the post-processor configuration:

HCL Example:

```hcl
source "null" "example" {
    communicator = "none"
}

build {
    sources = [
        "source.null.example"
    ]

    post-processors {
      post-processor "vsphere"{
          vm_name             = "foo"
          host                = "vcenter.example.com"
          username            = "administrator@vsphere.local"
          password            = "VMw@re1!"
          datacenter          = "dc-01"
          cluster             = "cluster-01"
          datastore           = "datastore-01"
          vm_network          = "VM Network"
          keep_input_artifact = true
      }
    }
}
```

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "null",
      "communicator": "none"
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    [
      {
        "type": "vsphere",
        "vm_name": "foo",
        "host": "vcenter.example.com",
        "username": "administrator@vsphere.local",
        "password": "VMw@re1!",
        "datacenter": "dc-01",
        "cluster": "cluster-01",
        "datastore": "datastore-01",
        "vm_network": "VM Network",
        "keep_input_artifact": true,
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Privileges

The post-processor uses `ovftool` and needs several privileges to be able to run `ovftool`.

Rather than giving Administrator access, you can create a role to give the post-processor the
privileges necessary to run.

Below is an example role that will work. Please note that this is a user-supplied list so there may
be a few extraneous privileges that are not strictly required.

For vSphere, the role needs the following privileges:

- `Datastore.AllocateSpace`
- `Host.Config.AdvancedConfig`
- `Host.Config.NetService`
- `Host.Config.Network`
- `Network.Assign`
- `System.Anonymous`
- `System.Read`
- `System.View`
- `VApp.Import`
- `VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk`
- `VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig`
- `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete`

The role must be authorized on the:

- Cluster of the host.
- The destination folder.
- The destination datastore.
- The network to be assigned.
