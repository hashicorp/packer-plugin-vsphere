# vSphere Template Post-Processor

Type: `vsphere-template`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.post-processor.vsphere`

The Packer vSphere Template post-processor takes an artifact from the
`vmware-iso` builder, built on ESXi (i.e. remote) or an artifact from the
[vSphere](/docs/post-processors/vsphere) post-processor, marks the VM as a
template, and places it in the path of your choice.

## Configuration

There are many configuration options available for the post-processor. They are
provided below in two categories: required and optional parameters.

Required:

- `host` (string) - The vSphere endpoint that contains the VM built by the
  `vmware-iso` builder.

- `password` (string) - Password to use to authenticate to the vSphere
  endpoint.

- `username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to the vSphere
  endpoint.

Optional:

- `datacenter` (string) - If you have more than one, you will need to specify
  which one the ESXi host used.

- `folder` (string) - Target path where the template will be created.

- `insecure` (boolean) - If `true`, skips the verification of the server
  certificate. Default is `false`.

- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - Unlike most post-processors, this option
  has no effect for `vsphere-template`. This is because in order for a template
  to work, you can't delete the vm that you generate the template from. The
  vSphere Template post-processor will therefore always preserve the original
  VM.

- `snapshot_enable` (boolean) - Create a snapshot before marking as a
  template. Default is `false`.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - Name for the snapshot. Required when
  `snapshot_enable` is `true`.

- `snapshot_description` (string) - Description for the snapshot. Required
  when `snapshot_enable` is `true`.

- `reregister_vm` (boolean) - Use the method of unregister VM and reregister
  as a template, rather than using the `markAsTemplate` method.

  NOTE: If you are getting permission denied errors when trying to mark as a
  template, but it works fine in the vSphere UI, try setting this to `false`.
  Default is `true`.

## Example

An example is shown below, showing only the post-processor configuration:

```hcl
source "null" "example" {
    communicator = "none"
}

build {
    sources = [
        "source.null.example"
    ]

    post-processors {
      post-processor "vsphere-template"{
          host                = "vcenter.example.com"
          insecure            = false
          username            = "administrator@vsphere.local"
          password            = "VMw@re1!"
          datacenter          = "dc-01"   
          folder              = "/templates/os/distro"

## Using the vSphere Template with local builders

Once the [vSphere](/docs/post-processors/vsphere) post-processor takes an
artifact from the builder and uploads it to a vSphere endpoint, you may want
the VM to be marked as a template. Packer can do this for you automatically
using a sequence definition (a collection of post-processors that are treated
as as single pipeline, see [Post-Processors](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/post-processors)
for more information):

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
build {
    sources = [
        "source.null.example"
    ]

  post-processors {
    post-processor "vsphere" {
      # ...
    }

    post-processor "vsphere-template" {
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "null",
      "communicator": "none"
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    [
      {
        "type": "vsphere",
         ...
      },
      {
        "type": "vsphere-template",
         ...
      }
    ],
    {
      "type": "...",
      ...
    }
  ]
}


```

In the example above, the result of each builder is passed through the defined
sequence of post-processors starting with the `vsphere` post-processor which
will upload the artifact to a vSphere endpoint. The resulting artifact is then
passed on to the `vsphere-template` post-processor which handles marking a VM
as a template. In JSON, note that the `vsphere` and `vsphere-template`
post-processors can be paired together in their own array.

## Permissions

The vSphere post processor needs several privileges to be able to mark the
vm as a template. Rather than giving full administrator access, you can create
a role to give the post-processor the privileges necessary to run. Here is an
example role that will work. Please note that this is a user-supplied list so
there may be a few extraneous privilegess that are not strictly required.

For vSphere, the role needs the following privileges:

    `Datastore.AllocateSpace`
    `Host.Config.AdvancedConfig`
    `Host.Config.NetService`
    `Host.Config.Network`
    `Network.Assign`
    `System.Anonymous`
    `System.Read`
    `System.View`
    `VApp.Import`
    `VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk`
    `VirtualMachine.Config.AdvancedConfig`
    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Delete`

and either (if `reregister_vm` is `false`):

    `VirtualMachine.Provisioning.MarkAsTemplate`

or (if `reregister_vm` is `true` or unset):

    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Register`
    `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Unregister`

The role must be authorized on the:

    `Cluster of the host`
    `The destination folder`
    `The destination datastore`
    `The network to be assigned`

# Troubleshooting

Some users have reported that vSphere templates created from local vSphere builds
get their boot order reset to cdrom only instead of the original boot order
defined by the template. If this issue affects you, the solution is to set
`"bios.hddOrder": "scsi0:0"` in your builder's `vmx_data`.

Packer doesn't automatically do this for you because it causes strange upload
behavior in certain versions of `ovftool`.
