- `name` (string) - Basic filter with glob support (e.g. `ubuntu_basic*`). Defaults to `*`.
  Using strict globs will not reduce execution time because vSphere API
  returns the full inventory. But can be used for better readability over
  regular expressions.

- `name_regex` (string) - Extended name filter with regular expressions support
  (e.g. `ubuntu[-_]basic[0-9]*`). Default is empty. The match of the
  regular expression is checked by substring. Use `^` and `$` to define a
  full string. For example, the `^[^_]+$` filter will search names
  without any underscores. The expression must use
  [Go Regex Syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax).

- `template` (bool) - Filter to return only objects that are virtual machine templates.
  Defaults to `false` and returns all virtual machines.

- `host` (string) - Filter to search virtual machines only on the specified ESX host.

- `tag` ([]Tag) - Filter to return only the virtual machines that have attached all specified tags.
  Specify one or more `tag` blocks to define list of tags for the filter.
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
  	tag {
  	  category = "team"
  	  name     = "operations"
  	}
  	tag {
  	  category = "sla"
  	  name     = "gold"
  	}
  ```

- `latest` (bool) - This filter determines how to handle multiple virtual machines that were matched
  with all previous filters. Virtual machine creation time is being used to find
  the latest. By default, multiple matching machines results in an error.
