- `configuration_parameters` (map[string]string) - A map of key-value pairs to sent to the [`extraConfig`](https://dp-downloads.broadcom.com/api-content/apis/API_VWSA_001/8.0U3/html/ReferenceGuides/vim.vm.ConfigSpec.html#extraConfig).
  in the vSphere API's `VirtualMachineConfigSpec`.
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
    configuration_parameters = {
      "disk.EnableUUID" = "TRUE"
      "svga.autodetect" = "TRUE"
      "log.keepOld"     = "15"
    }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  
  ```json
    "configuration_parameters": {
      "disk.EnableUUID": "TRUE",
      "svga.autodetect": "TRUE",
      "log.keepOld": "15"
    }
  ```
  
  ~> **Note:** Configuration keys that would conflict with parameters that
  are explicitly configurable through other fields in the `ConfigSpec`` object
  are silently ignored. Refer to the [`VirtualMachineConfigSpec`](https://dp-downloads.broadcom.com/api-content/apis/API_VWSA_001/8.0U3/html/ReferenceGuides/vim.vm.ConfigSpec.html)
  in the vSphere API documentation.

- `tools_sync_time` (\*bool) - Enable or disable time synchronization between the guest operating system and the
  ESX host at startup and after VM operations that may introduce time drift (such
  as resume from suspend, vMotion, or snapshot restore). If set to `true`, time
  synchronization is explicitly enabled. If set to `false`, time synchronization is
  explicitly disabled. If omitted, the builder does not modify the virtual
  machine's time synchronization settings:
    - `vsphere-iso` builder uses the vSphere default for new virtual machines
       (`true`).
    - `vsphere-clone` builder inherits the setting from the source virtual machine.

- `tools_sync_time_periodically` (\*bool) - Enable or disable periodic time synchronization between the guest operating
  system and the ESX host. Use this setting only if the guest operating system does
  not have native time synchronization.
    - `vsphere-iso` builder uses the vSphere default for new virtual machines
       (`false`).
    - `vsphere-clone` builder inherits the setting from the source virtual machine.

- `tools_upgrade_policy` (bool) - Automatically check for and upgrade VMware Tools after a virtual machine
  power cycle. Defaults to `false`.
