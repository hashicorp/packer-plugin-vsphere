- `reattach_cdroms` (int) - The number of CD-ROM devices to reattach to the final build artifact.
  Range: 0 - 4. Defaults to 0.
  
  -> **Note:** If set to 0, the step is skipped. When set to a value in the
  range, `remove_cdrom` is ignored and the CD-ROM devices are kept without
  any attached media.
