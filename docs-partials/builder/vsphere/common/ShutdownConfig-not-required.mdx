- `shutdown_command` (string) - Specify a virtual machine guest shutdown command. This command will be run using
  the `communicator`. Otherwise, the VMware Tools are used to gracefully shut down
  the virtual machine.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Amount of time to wait for graceful shut down of the virtual machine.
  Defaults to `5m` (5 minutes).
  This will likely need to be modified if the `communicator` is 'none'.

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through a `preseed.cfg`, a script or the final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.
