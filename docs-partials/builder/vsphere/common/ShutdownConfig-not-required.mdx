- `shutdown_command` (string) - Specify a VM guest shutdown command. This command will be executed using
  the `communicator`. Otherwise, the VMware Tools are used to gracefully shutdown
  the VM.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Amount of time to wait for graceful VM shutdown.
  Defaults to 5m or five minutes.
  This will likely need to be modified if the `communicator` is 'none'.

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through a preseed.cfg, a script or the final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of five minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.

- `shutdown_polling_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Wait duration between polling if the VM is shutdown. Defaults to 10 seconds wait between each IsVMDown() call

- `pause_before_shutdown` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time to wait before packer checks if the VM is off and send the shutdown command. Defaults to 0
