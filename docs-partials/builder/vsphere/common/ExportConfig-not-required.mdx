- `name` (string) - Name of the ovf. defaults to the name of the VM

- `force` (bool) - Overwrite ovf if it exists

- `images` (bool) - Deprecated: Images will be removed in a future release. Please see `image_files` for more details on this argument.

- `image_files` (bool) - In exported files, include additional image files that are attached to the VM, such as nvram, iso, img.

- `manifest` (string) - Generate manifest using sha1, sha256, sha512. Defaults to 'sha256'. Use 'none' for no manifest.

- `options` ([]string) - Advanced ovf export options. Options can include:
  * mac - MAC address is exported for all ethernet devices
  * uuid - UUID is exported for all virtual machines
  * extraconfig - all extra configuration options are exported for a virtual machine
  * nodevicesubtypes - resource subtypes for CD/DVD drives, floppy drives, and serial and parallel ports are not exported
  
  For example, adding the following export config option would output the mac addresses for all Ethernet devices in the ovf file:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  ...
    "export": {
      "options": ["mac"]
    },
  ```
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
  ...
    export {
      options = ["mac"]
    }
  ```
