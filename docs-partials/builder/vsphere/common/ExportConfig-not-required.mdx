- `name` (string) - The name of the exported image in Open Virtualization Format (OVF).
  
  -> **Note:** The name of the virtual machine with the `.ovf` extension is
  used if this option is not specified.

- `force` (bool) - Forces the export to overwrite existing files. Defaults to `false`.
  If set to `false`, an error is returned if the file(s) already exists.

- `image_files` (bool) - Include additional image files that are  associated with the virtual
  machine. Defaults to `false`. For example, `.nvram` and `.log` files.

- `manifest` (string) - The hash algorithm to use when generating a manifest file. Defaults to
  `sha256`.
  
  The available options for this setting are: 'none', 'sha1', 'sha256', and
  'sha512'.
  
  --> **Tip:** Use `none` to disable the creation of a manifest file.

- `options` ([]string) - Advanced image export options. Available options include:
  * `mac` - MAC address is exported for each Ethernet device.
  * `uuid` - UUID is exported for the virtual machine.
  * `extraconfig` - Extra configuration options are exported for the
    virtual machine.
  * `nodevicesubtypes` - Resource subtypes for CD/DVD drives, floppy
    drives, and SCSI controllers are not exported.
  
  For example, adding the following export configuration option outputs the
  MAC addresses for each Ethernet device in the OVF descriptor:
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
  ...
    export {
      options = ["mac"]
    }
  ```
  
  JSON: Example:
  
  ```json
  ...
    "export": {
      "options": ["mac"]
    },
  ```

- `output_format` (string) - The output format for the exported virtual machine image.
  Defaults to `ovf`. Available options include `ovf` and `ova`.
  
  When set to `ova`, the image is first exported using Open Virtualization
  Format (`.ovf`) and then converted to an Open Virtualization Archive
  (`.ova`) using the VMware [Open Virtualization Format Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest)
  (ovftool). The intermediate files are removed after the conversion.
  
  ~> **Note:** To use the `ova` format option, VMware ovftool must be
  installed on the Packer host and accessible in either the system `PATH`
  or the user's `PATH`.
