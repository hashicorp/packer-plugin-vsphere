- `name` (string) - Name of the exported image in Open Virtualization Format (OVF).
  The name of the virtual machine with the `.ovf` extension is used if this option is not specified.

- `force` (bool) - Forces the export to overwrite existing files. Defaults to false.
  If set to false, the export will fail if the files already exists.

- `image_files` (bool) - Include additional image files that are that are associated with the virtual machine. Defaults to false.
  For example, `.nvram` and `.log` files.

- `manifest` (string) - Generate a manifest file with the specified hash algorithm. Defaults to `sha256`.
  Available options include `none`, `sha1`, `sha256`, and `sha512`. Use `none` for no manifest.

- `options` ([]string) - Advanced image export options. Options can include:
  * mac - MAC address is exported for each Ethernet device.
  * uuid - UUID is exported for the virtual machine.
  * extraconfig - Extra configuration options are exported for the virtual machine.
  * nodevicesubtypes - Resource subtypes for CD/DVD drives, floppy drives, and serial and parallel ports are not exported.
  
  For example, adding the following export config option outputs the MAC addresses for each Ethernet device in the OVF descriptor:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  ...
    "export": {
      "options": ["mac"]
    },
  ```
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
  ...
    export {
      options = ["mac"]
    }
  ```
