- `name` (string) - Name of the exported image in Open Virtualization Format (OVF).
  The name of the virtual machine with the `.ovf` extension is used if this option is not specified.

- `force` (bool) - Forces the export to overwrite existing files. Defaults to `false`.
  If set to `false`, an error is returned if the file(s) already exists.

- `image_files` (bool) - Include additional image files that are that are associated with the virtual machine. Defaults to `false`.
  For example, `.nvram` and `.log` files.

- `manifest` (string) - Generate a manifest file with the specified hash algorithm. Defaults to `sha256`.
  Available options include `none`, `sha1`, `sha256`, and `sha512`. Use `none` for no manifest.

- `options` ([]string) - Advanced image export options. Available options can include:
  - mac - MAC address is exported for each Ethernet device.
  - uuid - UUID is exported for the virtual machine.
  - extraconfig - Extra configuration options are exported for the virtual machine.
  - nodevicesubtypes - Resource subtypes for CD/DVD drives, floppy drives, and serial and parallel ports are not exported.
  
  For example, adding the following export config option outputs the MAC addresses for each Ethernet device in the OVF descriptor:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  ...
    "export": {
      "options": ["mac"]
    },
  ```
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
  ...
    export {
      options = ["mac"]
    }
  ```

- `output_format` (string) - The output format for the exported virtual machine image. Defaults to `ovf`.
  Available options include `ovf` and `ova`.
  
  When set to `ova`, the image is first exported using Open Virtualization
  / Format (`.ovf`) and then converted to an Open Virtualization Archive
  (`.ova`) using the VMware [Open Virtualization Format Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest)
  (ovftool). The intermediate files are removed after the conversion.
  
  ~> **Note:** To use the `ova` format option, VMware ovftool must be
  installed on the Packer host and accessible in either the system `PATH`
  or the user's `PATH`.
