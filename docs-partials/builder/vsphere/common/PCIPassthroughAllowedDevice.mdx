Dynamic DirectPath I/O is component of the Assignable Hardware framework in VMware vSphere.
Dynamic DirectPath I/O enables the Assignable Hardware intelligence for passthrough devices and
the hardware address of the PCIe device is no longer directly mapped to the virtual machine
configuration. Instead, the attributes, or capabilities, are exposed to the virtual machine.
