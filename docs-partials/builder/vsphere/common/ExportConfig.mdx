You can export an image in Open Virtualization Format (OVF) to the Packer host.

Example usage:

In JSON:
```json
...

	"vm_name": "example-ubuntu",

...

	"export": {
	  "force": true,
	  "output_directory": "./output-artifacts"
	},

```
In HCL2:
```hcl

	# ...
	vm_name = "example-ubuntu"
	# ...
	export {
	  force = true
	  output_directory = "./output-artifacts"
	}

```
The above configuration would create the following files:

```text
./output-artifacts/example-ubuntu-disk-0.vmdk
./output-artifacts/example-ubuntu.mf
./output-artifacts/example-ubuntu.ovf
```
