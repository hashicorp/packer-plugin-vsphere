- `library` (string) - The name of the content library in which the new content library item
  containing the template will be created or updated. The content library
  must be of type Local to allow deploying virtual machines.

- `name` (string) - The name of the content library item that will be created or updated.
  For VM templates, the name of the item should be different from
  [vm_name](#vm_name) and the default is [vm_name](#vm_name) + timestamp
  when not set. VM templates will always be imported to a new library item.
  For OVF templates, the name defaults to [vm_name](#vm_name) when not set,
  and if an item with the same name already exists it will be then updated
  with the new OVF template, otherwise a new item will be created.
  
  ~> **Note:** It's not possible to update existing content library items
  with a new VM template. If updating an existing content library item is
  necessary, use an OVF template instead by setting the [ovf](#ovf) option
  as `true`.

- `description` (string) - A description for the content library item that will be created.
  Defaults to "Packer imported [vm_name](#vm_name) VM template".

- `cluster` (string) - The cluster where the VM template will be placed.
  If `cluster` and `resource_pool` are both specified, `resource_pool` must
  belong to cluster. If `cluster` and `host` are both specified, the ESXi
  host must be a member of the cluster. This option is not used when
  importing OVF templates. Defaults to [`cluster`](#cluster).

- `folder` (string) - The virtual machine folder where the VM template will be placed.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates. Defaults to
  the same folder as the source virtual machine.

- `host` (string) - The ESXi host where the virtual machine template will be placed.
  If `host` and `resource_pool` are both specified, `resource_pool` must
  belong to host. If `host` and `cluster` are both specified, `host` must
  be a member of the cluster. This option is not used when importing OVF
  templates. Defaults to [`host`](#host).

- `resource_pool` (string) - The resource pool where the virtual machine template will be placed.
  Defaults to [`resource_pool`](#resource_pool). If [`resource_pool`](#resource_pool)
  is unset, the system will attempt to choose a suitable resource pool
  for the VM template.

- `datastore` (string) - The datastore for the virtual machine template's configuration and log
  files. This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to the storage backing associated with the content library.

- `destroy` (bool) - Destroy the virtual machine after the import to the content library.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `ovf` (bool) - Import an OVF template to the content library item. Defaults to `false`.

- `skip_import` (bool) - Skip the import to the content library item. Useful during a build test
  stage. Defaults to `false`.

- `ovf_flags` ([]string) - Flags to use for OVF package creation. The supported flags can be
  obtained using ExportFlag.list. If unset, no flags will be used.
  Known values: `EXTRA_CONFIG`, `PRESERVE_MAC`.
