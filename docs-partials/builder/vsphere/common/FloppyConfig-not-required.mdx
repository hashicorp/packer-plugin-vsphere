- `floppy_img_path` (string) - Datastore path to a floppy image that will be mounted to the virtual
  machine. Example: `[datastore] iso/foo.flp`.

- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of local files to be mounted to the virtual machine's floppy
  drive.

- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to copy files from.

- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and
  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or
  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them
  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in
  `floppy_content` will take precedence.
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
  floppy_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  ```

- `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that is attached when the virtual
  machine is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init, Kickstart or other
  early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.
  By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.
