- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the virtual machine.

- `folder` (string) - The virtual machine folder where the virtual machine is created.

- `cluster` (string) - The cluster where the virtual machine is created.
  Refer to the [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)
  section for more details.

- `host` (string) - The ESXi host where the virtual machine is created. A full path must be
  specified if the ESXi host is in a folder. For example `folder/host`.
  Refer to the [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)
  section for more details.

- `resource_pool` (string) - The resource pool where the virtual machine is created.
  If this is not specified, the root resource pool associated with the
  `host` or `cluster` is used.
  
  ~> **Note:**  The full path to the resource pool must be provided.
  For example, a simple resource pool path might resemble `rp-packer` and
  a nested path might resemble 'rp-packer/rp-linux-images'.

- `datastore` (string) - The datastore where the virtual machine is created.
  Required if `host` is a cluster, or if `host` has multiple datastores.

- `set_host_for_datastore_uploads` (bool) - The ESXI host used for uploading files to the datastore.
  Defaults to `false`.
