- `vm_name` (string) - Name of the virtual machine.

- `folder` (string) - VM folder where the virtual machine is created.

- `cluster` (string) - vSphere cluster where the virtual machine is created. See the
  [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)
  section above for more details.

- `host` (string) - ESXi host where the virtual machine is created. A full path must be
  specified if the host is in a folder. For example `folder/host`. See the
  [Working With Clusters And Hosts](#working-with-clusters-and-hosts)
  section above for more details.

- `resource_pool` (string) - vSphere resource pool where the virtual machine is created.
  If this is not specified, the root resource pool associated with the
  `host` or `cluster` is used.
  Note that the full path to the resource pool must be provided.
  For example, a simple resource pool path might resemble `rp-packer` and
  a nested path might resemble 'rp-packer/rp-linux-images'.

- `datastore` (string) - vSphere datastore where the virtual machine is created.
  Required if `host` is a cluster, or if `host` has multiple datastores.

- `set_host_for_datastore_uploads` (bool) - Specifies that the host is used for uploading files to the datastore.
  Defaults to false.
