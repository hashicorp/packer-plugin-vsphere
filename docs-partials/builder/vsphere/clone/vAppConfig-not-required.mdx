- `properties` (map[string]string) - Specifies the values for the available vApp properties. These are used to supply
  configuration parameters to a virtual machine. This machine is cloned from a template
  that originated from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  
  -> **Note:** The only supported usage path for vApp properties is for existing
  user-configurable keys. These generally come from an existing template that was
  created from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  
  You cannot set values for vApp properties on virtual machines created from scratch,
  on virtual machines that lack a vApp configuration, or on property keys that do not exist.
