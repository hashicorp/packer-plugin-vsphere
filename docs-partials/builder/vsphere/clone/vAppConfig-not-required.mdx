- `properties` (map[string]string) - The values for the available vApp properties. These are used to supply
  configuration parameters to a virtual machine. This machine is cloned
  from a template that originated from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  
  -> **Note:** The only supported usage path for vApp properties is for
  existing user-configurable keys. These generally come from an existing
  template that was created from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  
  You cannot set values for vApp properties on virtual machines created
  from scratch, on virtual machines that lack a vApp configuration, or on
  property keys that do not exist.
  
  HCL Example:
  
  ```hcl
    vapp {
      properties = {
        hostname  = var.hostname
        user-data = base64encode(var.user_data)
      }
      deployment_option = "small"
    }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  
  ```json
    "vapp": {
        "properties": {
            "hostname": "{{ user `hostname`}}",
            "user-data": "{{ env `USERDATA`}}"
        },
        "deployment_option": "small"
    }
  ```
  
  A `user-data` field requires the content of a YAML file to be encoded
  with base64. This can be done using an environment variable:
  
  ```console
  export USERDATA=$(gzip -c9 <userdata.yaml | { base64 -w0 2>/dev/null || base64; })
  ```

- `deployment_option` (string) - The deployment configuration to use when deploying from an OVF/OVA file.
  This corresponds to deployment configurations defined in an OVF descriptor.
  -> **Note:** Only applicable when using remote OVF/OVA sources.
