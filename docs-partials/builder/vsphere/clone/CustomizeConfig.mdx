A cloned virtual machine can be [customized](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-58E346FF-83AE-42B8-BE58-253641D257BC.html)
to configure host, network, or licensing settings.

To perform virtual machine customization as a part of the clone process, specify the customize block with the

for guest OS customization on vSphere.
See the [customization example](#customization-example) for a usage synopsis.
