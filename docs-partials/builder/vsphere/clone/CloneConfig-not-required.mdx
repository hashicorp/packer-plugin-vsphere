- `template` (string) - The name of the source virtual machine to clone.

- `disk_size` (int64) - The size of the primary disk in MiB. Cannot be used with `linked_clone`.
  -> **Note:** Only the primary disk size can be specified. Additional
  disks are not supported.

- `linked_clone` (bool) - Create the virtual machine as a linked clone from the latest snapshot.
  Defaults to `false`. Cannot be used with `disk_size`.`

- `network` (string) - The network to which the virtual machine will connect.
  
  For example:
  
  - Name: `<NetworkName>`
  - Inventory Path: `/<DatacenterName>/<FolderName>/<NetworkName>`
  - Managed Object ID (Port Group): `Network:network-<xxxxx>`
  - Managed Object ID (Distributed Port Group): `DistributedVirtualPortgroup::dvportgroup-<xxxxx>`
  - Logical Switch UUID: `<uuid>`
  - Segment ID: `/infra/segments/<SegmentID>`
  
  ~> **Note:** If more than one network resolves to the same name, either
  the inventory path to network or an ID must be provided.
  
  ~> **Note:** If no network is specified, provide `host` to allow the
  plugin to search for an available network.

- `mac_address` (string) - The network card MAC address. For example `00:50:56:00:00:00`.
  If set, the `network` must be also specified.

- `notes` (string) - The annotations for the virtual machine.

- `destroy` (bool) - Destroy the virtual machine after the build is complete.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vapp` (vAppConfig) - The vApp Options for the virtual machine. For more information, refer to
  the [vApp Options Configuration](/packer/plugins/builders/vmware/vsphere-clone#vapp-options-configuration)
