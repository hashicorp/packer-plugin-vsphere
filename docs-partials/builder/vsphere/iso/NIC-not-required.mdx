- `network` (string) - The network to which the virtual machine will connect.
  
  For example:
  
  - Name: `<NetworkName>`
  - Inventory Path: `/<DatacenterName>/<FolderName>/<NetworkName>`
  - Managed Object ID (Port Group): `Network:network-<xxxxx>`
  - Managed Object ID (Distributed Port Group): `DistributedVirtualPortgroup::dvportgroup-<xxxxx>`
  - Logical Switch UUID: `<uuid>`
  - Segment ID: `/infra/segments/<SegmentID>`
  
  ~> **Note:** If more than one network resolves to the same name, either
  the inventory path to network or an ID must be provided.
  
  ~> **Note:** If no network is specified, provide `host` to allow the
  plugin to search for an available network.

- `mac_address` (string) - The network card MAC address. For example `00:50:56:00:00:00`.
