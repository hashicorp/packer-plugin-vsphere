If no adapter is defined, network tasks (communicators, most provisioners)
will not work, so it's advised to define one.

Example configuration with two network adapters:

HCL Example:

```hcl

	network_adapters {
	    network = "VM Network"
	    network_card = "vmxnet3"
	}
	network_adapters {
	    network = "OtherNetwork"
	    network_card = "vmxnet3"
	}

```

JSON Example:

```json

	"network_adapters": [
	  {
	    "network": "VM Network",
	    "network_card": "vmxnet3"
	  },
	  {
	    "network": "OtherNetwork",
	    "network_card": "vmxnet3"
	  }
	],

```
