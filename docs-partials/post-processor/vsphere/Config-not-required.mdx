- `disk_mode` (string) - The disk format of the target virtual machine. One of `thin`, `thick`,

- `esxi_host` (string) - The fully qualified domain name or IP address of the ESXi host to upload the
  virtual machine. This is _not required_ if `host` is a vCenter Server.

- `insecure` (bool) - Skip the verification of the server certificate. Defaults to `false`.

- `options` ([]string) - Options to send to `ovftool` when uploading the virtual machine.
  Use `ovftool --help` to list all the options available.

- `overwrite` (bool) - Overwrite existing files.
  If `true`, forces overwrites of existing files. Defaults to `false`.

- `resource_pool` (string) - The name of the resource pool to place the virtual machine.

- `vm_folder` (string) - The name of the virtual machine folder path where the virtual machine will be
  placed.

- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the virtual machine to be created on the vSphere endpoint.

- `vm_network` (string) - The name of the network in which to place the virtual machine.

- `hardware_version` (string) - The maximum virtual hardware version for the deployed virtual machine.
  
  It does not upgrade the virtual hardware version of the source VM. Instead, it limits the
  virtual hardware version of the deployed virtual machine  to the specified version.
  If the source virtual machine's hardware version is higher than the specified version, the
  deployed virtual machine's hardware version will be downgraded to the specified version.
  
  If the source virtual machine's hardware version is lower than or equal to the specified
  version, the deployed virtual machine's hardware version will be the same as the source
  virtual machine's.
  
  This option is useful when deploying to vCenter Server instance ot an ESXi host whose
  version is different than the one used to create the artifact.
  
  Refer to [KB 315655](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=315655)
  for more information on supported virtual hardware versions.

- `max_retries` (int) - The maximum number of times to retry the upload operation if it fails.
  Defaults to `5`.
